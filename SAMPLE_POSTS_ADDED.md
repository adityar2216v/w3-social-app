## 🎯 **HOW IT WORKS**

### **Smart Fallback System:**

The app now uses a **smart fallback system**:

1. **If backend is connected and has posts** → Shows real posts
2. **If backend has no posts** → Shows sample posts
3. **If backend is not available** → Shows sample posts

### **Demo Banner:**

When viewing sample posts, users see a blue info banner:
- 📱 **"Demo Mode"** badge
- **"Sample Posts"** chip
- Message: "You're viewing sample posts to showcase the UI. Sign up and create your own posts!"

✅ **Beautiful images** (from Unsplash - high quality)  
✅ **Likes and comments** (realistic engagement)

## 💡 **HOW TO SWITCH TO REAL POSTS**
